    iterator - "i++" this means that for the loop, the new variable of "i" is equal to i+1
    i++
    i = i+1
    i = 2+1
    i+2 instead of i++ means the loop will go up in 2s instead of 1
*/

// i=initialisation - let i=0 means let the starting point be 0

console.log("hello")

for (let i=0;  i<=100;  i++){
    console.log("hello " +i)
}
